# YOLOv5 Custom Dataset Application

This repository contains my work on using the [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) object detection model on a custom dataset. The original YOLOv5 repository by [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics) can be found [here](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).

## Overview

YOLOv5 is a state-of-the-art object detection model that provides excellent accuracy and performance. This project demonstrates how to train YOLOv5 on a custom dataset and evaluate its performance.

## Features

- Clone of the original YOLOv5 repository.
- Training of YOLOv5 on a custom dataset.
- Evaluation of the trained model on a custom test set.
- Instructions and scripts for reproducing the results.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
